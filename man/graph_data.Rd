\title{Graph Z-Score Distributions and Animate Histograms by Sample}
\usage{
graph_data(
  data,
  ci = NULL,
  xlim = c(-4, 4),
  compile_gif = FALSE,
  fps = 2,
  filename = "output.gif",
  samples = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  a = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame where each column represents a vector of z-scores from a different sample.}

\item{ci}{A numeric scalar indicating the critical z-score value (e.g., 1.96 for 95\% confidence).
Must not be \code{NULL}.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the x-axis limits of the histogram. Default is \code{c(-4, 4)}.}

\item{compile_gif}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, compiles all histogram plots into an animated GIF using ImageMagick. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fps}{Numeric. Frames per second for the GIF animation. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{filename}{Character string. Name of the output GIF file (if \code{compile_gif = TRUE}). Default is \code{"output.gif"}.}

\item{samples}{Optional. Label to indicate the number of distributions represented (used in plot title). Should be a scalar or \code{NULL}.}

\item{n}{Optional. A vector of sample sizes for each column of \code{data}. Used in plot annotations. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{a}{Optional. A vector of rejection rates corresponding to each column of \code{data}. Used in plot annotations. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
This function is invoked for its side effects:
\itemize{
\item Saves individual \code{.png} histogram plots to the working directory.
\item Optionally compiles those plots into a \code{.gif} using ImageMagick if \code{compile_gif = TRUE}.
}
No R object is returned.
}
\description{
Creates histograms of z-score distributions from a data frame and optionally compiles them into an animated GIF.
Each column of the data frame is treated as a separate sample distribution.
}
\details{
Red vertical dashed lines are drawn at Â±\code{ci} to represent critical values. Additional text annotations show
sample size and rejection rate, if provided.

Histograms are generated using \code{ggplot2}, with consistent formatting for serif fonts and minimal gridlines.
ImageMagick (via the \code{magick} package) is used to stitch together frames for animation.

The file names for individual frames follow the format \code{"frame_###.png"}, and are automatically deleted after GIF creation.

\examples{
# Example data
df <- data.frame(
  sample1 = rnorm(100),
  sample2 = rnorm(100, mean = 0.5)
)

# Basic plot without GIF
graph_data(df, ci = 1.96, samples = 2, n = c(100, 100), a = c(0.05, 0.07))

# Create animated GIF
graph_data(df, ci = 1.96, samples = 2, n = c(100, 100), a = c(0.05, 0.07), compile_gif = TRUE)

}
