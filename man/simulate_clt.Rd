\title{Simulate Sampling Distributions for the Central Limit Theorem}
\usage{
simulate_clt(n = NULL, inverse = NULL, samples = 249, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A numeric vector of sample sizes. Each value in the vector represents a separate simulation size.}

\item{inverse}{A character string naming a built-in R distribution function that begins with "r" (e.g., "rnorm", "rbeta").
Must be one of a predefined set of supported inverse functions.}

\item{samples}{An integer indicating the number of samples to draw per sample size. Defaults to 249.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the specified inverse distribution function (e.g., \code{shape1}, \code{shape2} for \code{rbeta}).}
}
\value{
A data frame with \code{samples} rows and \code{length(n)} columns. Each column corresponds to a sample size in \code{n}, and each row
represents a standardized sample drawn from the specified distribution and resampled with replacement.
}
\description{
This function simulates sampling distributions of standardized sample means
using various inverse distribution functions to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem.
}
\details{
The function first generates random data from the specified inverse function, optionally using extra parameters.
It then standardizes the values (z-scores), removes rows with \code{NA}, and performs resampling with replacement from each
column of standardized values. The result is a data frame of simulated CLT sampling distributions.
}
\examples{
# Simulate CLT sampling distributions from a Cauchy distribution
simulate_clt(n = c(10, 50, 100), inverse = "rcauchy")

# Simulate with extra distribution parameters
simulate_clt(n = c(30, 60), inverse = "rbeta", shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)
